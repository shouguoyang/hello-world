I am a Ph.D. student from Beijing Key Laboratory of Internet of Things Security, Institute of Information Engineering ([IIE](http://www.iie.ac.cn/)), Chinese Academy of Sciences ([CAS](https://english.cas.cn/)) under the supervision of Prof. [Zhiqiang Shi](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0003476), since September 2017.

My current research interests focus on binary code similarity detection (i.e. function matching), patch detection, and vulnerability detection based on static analysis.
I am also interested in symbolic execution for program analysis.

From August 2021, I started my one-year research assistant in cyber security lab at [NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg).

I received my Bachelor Degree in [College of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cise.sdust.edu.cn/), Shandong University of Science and Technology in June, 2017.
